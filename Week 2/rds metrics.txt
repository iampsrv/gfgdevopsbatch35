1. BurstBalance
Unit: Percent
Description: Represents the percentage of CPU credits available for burstable performance instances (e.g., T3, T4g).

Higher value = More CPU credits available.

Watch for: Dropping values could indicate sustained high CPU usage.

2. CheckpointLag
Unit: Seconds

Description: The amount of time a replication source database is ahead of a read replica (used in PostgreSQL/Aurora).

Higher value = More lag; replication is falling behind.

Watch for: Consistently high values indicate replication issues.

3. CPUCreditBalance
Unit: Count

Description: Number of unused CPU credits accumulated for burstable instances.

Used to burst when your instance needs more CPU.

Low balance = Instance may be throttled.

4. CPUCreditUsage
Unit: Count

Description: Number of CPU credits consumed during a given period.

High usage = Instance has been bursting.

Important for performance analysis of T-series instances.

5. CPUSurplusCreditBalance
Unit: Count

Description: Number of surplus CPU credits earned (used in T3/T4 instances).

Only relevant when unlimited burst mode is on.

6. CPUSurplusCreditsCharged
Unit: Count

Description: Number of surplus CPU credits charged to the account.

Indicates if you're paying for over-bursting (when in unlimited mode).

7. CPUUtilization
Unit: Percent

Description: Percentage of CPU being used.

Most critical metric for general health.

High values over time may mean you need to scale.

8. DatabaseConnections
Unit: Count

Description: Number of active client connections to the database.

Important for connection pool sizing and scaling.

9. DBLoad
Unit: Custom/Amazon-defined

Description: Total database load (Aurora only).

Represents all active sessions (CPU and I/O waits).

Useful for workload analysis.

10. DBLoadCPU
Unit: Custom

Description: Portion of DBLoad that is CPU-related.

Indicates CPU contention.

11. DBLoadNonCPU
Unit: Custom

Description: Portion of DBLoad due to non-CPU waits (e.g., I/O, locks).

High value = Potential performance bottlenecks not related to CPU.

12. DBLoadRelativeToNumVCPUs
Unit: Custom

Description: Load normalized by the number of vCPUs.

> 1 = DB is overloading its available vCPU resources.

Helps assess if scaling is needed.
